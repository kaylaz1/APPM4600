This repo contains files for the course APPM4600 and the University of Colorado Boulder. There are two main files: Homeworks and Labs. The Homeworks file will contain all the homework completed for this course in the Spring 2024 semester. The Labs folder will contain all the labs performed. Each lab particularly will have a subfolder within the main Labs folder. Homeworks files are expected to be typed in LaTeX and will be uploaded as they're completed. Lab deliverables will also be typed and uploaded when completed. Additional details will be added to this description if needed.
